    Purpose of File:
        To implement the ElementLine class. This will be an abstraction
        used to make the swipe operations easier

'''


class ElementLine:

    #Grid will hold reference to a matrix
    grid = []
    #stride will represent the absolute value of the number needed to reach the next element in the array
    stride = 0
    length = 0
    direction = 0

    def __init__(self, board, row_or_column, line_number, direction):
        pass


    def getElement(self, index):
        pass


    def setElement(self, index, element):
        pass
