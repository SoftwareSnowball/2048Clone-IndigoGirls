Tasks needed:
    Be able to perform the swipe operation in any direction
    Check that swipe direction is valid
    Returns gamestatus error if nothing is changed on the board


Propose Data structure:
    line_element - an abstraction which can represent a line or a column in either direction.
                    The purpose of this construct is to abstract the process of swiping so that
                    direction agnostic swipe code can be written.


High Level Design

    Swipe:
            Will be the basic function called by dispatch and will return the finished board
            or game status error.

    create_line_element:
            Will create a line element representing a given row or column with appropriate direction
            The line element should hold a pointer to the actual grid structure so that changes made
            through the line_element will be reflected in the grid.
